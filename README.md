# Introduction

This is a multi-modal fusion approach based on VGG16 and FastText for identifying useful information collected from social media platforms. 

# Dataset

[CrisisMMD] (https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/crisismmd)

The dataset includes images and text messages. 



# Requirements

The following environments is tested:

- `Anaconda` with `python >= 3.6`
- `pytorch>=1.5, torchvision, cuda`
- `FastText=0.9.2`

# Train on Dataset

- According to Excels in the dataset, images and text messages are matched to form a pair.

- Text messages needs to be preprocessed.
